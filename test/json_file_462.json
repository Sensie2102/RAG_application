    "Task Title": "5. Start retarget console wv and atc at 500",
    "Metric Targeted": "Marketing",
    "Predicted Action": "Start RTO adjusted",
    "Predicted Intent": "Intent\n- To reduce overall\u00c2\u00a0RTO\n- Expailnation: In the normal Conversion Campaign, we pass only purchase events as the campaign's audience learning, giving us the cheapest possible marketing cost. With RTO Adjusted Marketing, we also pass yesterday's delivered events/orders along with the purchase events. Hence, there is no reason for our marketing to become expensive because the purchase events are still passed as before. \nBut the delivered events increase the audience on our campaign which have the intent to accept their orders hence increasing our net delivery%. Thus\u00c2\u00a0minimizing\u00c2\u00a0RTO.\n\nResults\n- Benefits: Significant reduction in RTOs by 5-10%, giving us decent improvement in our profits and buffer to scale/grow our account further. \nTrade-off: In 99% of the cases, marketing cost has remained the same and even become cheaper in some cases. In the rest 1% marketing cost has gone expensive that normal but that is mainly due to other external factors, not due to the RTO adjusted\u00c2\u00a0action.\n\nExamples\n- Serene Silk Marketing Cost was cheaper and RTO got reduced by 7-8%\n- In Street Mod, Marketing cost remained exactly the same and RTO got reduced by 5%"
