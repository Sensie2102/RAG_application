    "Task Title": "correct naming for all products",
    "Metric Targeted": "Marketing",
    "Predicted Action": "Change product naming/Improve product naming",
    "Predicted Intent": "1. In an ad, customers only see the first 2-3 words of the product name. Giving as much important information about the product in these few words, helps in making it clear to the customer exactly what they'll be receiving if they place an order. For example, if you're selling a set of a few products, starting naming with \"Set of x\" helps. \n2. On the product page, all the information we give customers about our products play a part in driving them to place an order. Avoiding spelling errors, keeping the names short by removing any irrelevant/redundant words are good practices. "
