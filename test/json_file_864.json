    "Predicted Intent": "Intent \n- Our audience right now is very vast which is giving us a cheaper marketing cost but higher RTOs. \n- We want to narrow down our audience and target only the audience with the intent of buying\u00c2\u00a0our\u00c2\u00a0products.\n\nResults\n- Marketing cost may be slightly higher/expensive. \n- We might get a better delivery rate with this campaign since the people buying with this ad will have an intent to buy our products. Conversions are not just purchase driven, they are\u00c2\u00a0intent\u00c2\u00a0driven\n\nExamples\n- Urban Cultry: Interest based audience has given the same marketing cost as other campaigns and the individual interest campaign has given lower RTOs\n- Saree Meniya- Marketing cost is higher compared to other campaigns but still we have seen reductions\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0RTOs"
