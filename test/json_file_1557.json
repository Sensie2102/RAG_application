    "Task Title": "remove irrelevent sizes from the size chart",
    "Metric Targeted": "Marketing",
    "Predicted Action": "Change size chart",
    "Predicted Intent": "1. Reduces RTOs and Returns\nA clear and accurate size chart helps customers choose the right size the first time, and not be unsure about the fit of the product they'll receive, reducing the likelihood of RTOs, returns and exchanges due to improper fit. This improves customer satisfaction and saves the business money on processing returns and shipping replacements.\n\n2. Builds trust and confidence:\nProviding detailed size information demonstrates transparency and builds trust with customers. They feel more confident about their purchase knowing they have all the necessary information to make an informed decision.\n\n3. Improves conversion rates:\nWhen customers are unsure about sizing, they're more likely to abandon their carts. A size chart removes this uncertainty, leading to higher conversion rates and increased sales."
