    "Metric Targeted": "Marketing",
    "Predicted Action": "Move to flat rates",
    "Predicted Intent": "Intent\n- We move to flat rates when we want to lower our logistic cost\n- As on normal delivery rates, for example, 0.5kg Delhivery Surface charges 49rs and 30rs COD handling charge and if that gets parcel RTO we have to pay 0.9 of our forward charge, resulting in a total of 124rs, and on other hand flat rates for 0.5kg Delhivery Surface will charge us 89rs, including COD handling charge and RTO charge, so we save 35rs on order level\n\nResults\n- It directly relates to our l_nmv%\n- Reduction in significant logistic rates, when our RTO is high"
