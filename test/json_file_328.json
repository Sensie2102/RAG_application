    "Task Title": "Improve Grouping done - On best seller pack of 4 product check wrong grouping done - Add colours of pack inn grouping instead of multicolor for eg. ( blue/yellow/green )",
    "Metric Targeted": "Marketing",
    "Predicted Action": "Add product grouping",
    "Predicted Intent": "Grouping a set of products is done to give a customer easy access to products that are very similar to one that led them to the website. It provides very similar options and helps improve the chances of them placing an order. For example, all colors of a product can be grouped.\nThe downside of grouping though, is that once it's done, only one of the grouped products will be shown in the ad. For this reason, we avoid grouping, unless we're going to run a banner/video ad on a product."
