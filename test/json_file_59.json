    "Task Title": "make a product set of high c2pr product set kurta >2.5 -women only - 24+ - a/b testing (250 per adset - 1k overall )",
    "Metric Targeted": "Marketing",
    "Predicted Action": "Make product set for particular category/aov range",
    "Predicted Intent": "When a seller has products over a range - category/aov - sometimes we try to run different campaigns to target different audiences depending on the product set. For example, customers who are interested in sarees priced under Rs.500 aren't necessarily the same customers that will buy sarees worth Rs.2000 or more."
