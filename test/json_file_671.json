    "Task Title": "Run a/b testing camapign - 1k budget",
    "Metric Targeted": "Marketing",
    "Predicted Action": "Run campaign on specific product AOV",
    "Predicted Intent": "Intent: When we have a huge AOV range of products - mixer of both low AOV and high AOV, and when facebook is spending on both AOV products, but not able to give great results, then picking up an AOV range ourself and optimising ad level, audience and product page (testiomonilas, widgets) etc, anything and everything as per this AOV will help us give best in this particular AOV range we selected. \nResult : Will help our audience to have better user experience in terms of conversion improving C2PR. \nExample : For eg, I'm a customer who clicked an ad of product AOV 750 which is range of products 700-1000, where as all other widgets recently viewed, best sellers etc everything around is showing an AOV of 3000. Then if I want to explore more products of siilar AOV on which I clicked upon, say 700-1000, as I can't see those products, I might drop off in between. "
