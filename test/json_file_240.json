    "Task Title": "Edit deep clean tablet video to mention pack of 20 and company name",
    "Predicted Action": "Remove brand from product name",
    "Predicted Intent": "Intent : Product name is one of the important things that gets attention in ad along with image, and price. The first four words of product name is very important because that's what till people most read, and we need to give most of the clarity about product in this little. Adding brand name which is showing infront of all product names in taking out the understanding about our product being displayed at the moment and it's too repetitive. \n\nResult : Removing redundant words such as brand names will help us improve CPM which leads in lower CPC."
